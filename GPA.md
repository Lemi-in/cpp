## Exercise Grader Program
This C++ program is designed to assist in grading exercises by allowing users to input scores and maximum points for a set of exercises. The program then calculates the total score, the total maximum points, and computes the overall percentage based on the provided scores.


### How It Works
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter the number of exercises to be graded.
Input Validation:

For each exercise, the user is prompted to enter the score and the maximum points.
The program validates the input to ensure:
Scores are between 0 and 100.
Maximum points are positive.
Scores do not exceed the maximum points.
Calculation:

The program calculates the total points and total maximum points by summing up the scores and maximum points, respectively.
Overall Percentage:

The overall percentage is computed as (totalPoints / totalMaxPoints) * 100.0.
Results Display:

The program displays the user's total score, total maximum points, and the overall percentage.
